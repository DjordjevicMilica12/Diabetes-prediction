This project explores two different algorithms for diabetes prediction. We approached the problem as a binary classification task, where each instance had an "Outcome" column value of either 1 or 0, depending on whether the individual had diabetes or not.

We used Decision Trees and Gradient Boosting. However, the results were not satisfactory, as the models did not achieve the desired performance, especially in terms of recall. The main objective was to accurately predict True Positive values, which was unsuccessful. We identified the primary issue as an insufficient number of features used for prediction. As an improvement, we suggest expanding the dataset with additional features.

This project consisted of several stages: data preparation and preprocessing, feature selection, exploratory and graphical analysis, model building (training with different hyperparameters and selecting the best one), followed by testing and evaluation using performance metrics and a confusion matrix.
